‚öíÔ∏è REST API created with Node.js and Express.js using TypeScript

## üöÄ Getting Started

Clone the repository and install necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/classiuz/netse-api.git
# AND
cd netse-api
# AND
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and replace the values with real values.

```ini
# .env
URL=http://localhost
PORT=3090
ROOT_PATH=/api

DB_HOST=databaseHost
DB_USER=databaseUsername
DB_PASSWORD=databasePassword
DB_NAME=databaseName

API_KEY=KEY

SECRET_KEY=KEYWORD
```

For start the API in Development Mode run.

```bash
npm run dev
```

For start the API in Production Mode run.

```bash
npm run build 
# AND
npm run start
```

For Production purposes, is highly recommended install [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) package for process management. And run production command to clean unnecessary data.

```bash
npm run production
```

## üìñ Documentation

### üîê Authentication

Most routes are protected and an API KEY will need to be provided to access the information. The API KEY can be sent in three different ways:

1. Using Query params with `?key=VALUE`. For example

```htth
https://localhost:3090/api/users?key=KEY
```

2. Using `Authorization` header. For example
```http
GET https://localhost:3090/api/users
Authorization: KEY
```

3. Using the `body` of the request. For example
```http
GET https://localhost:3090/api/users
content-type: application/json

{
  "key": "KEY"  
}
```

## üìä Test 
For testing you need to install [REST Client](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) extension on your Visual Studio Code. Then check the key on `.env` file is valid key.

```ini
# .env
...

KEY=VALID KEY
```

Now you can test the api. Every file inside `test` folder represents an route, for example `/api/users` is `users.http` file, `/api/services` is `services.http` file and so on.
